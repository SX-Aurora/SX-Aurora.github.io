Welcome to a little blog which is dedicated to posting things we
learned about SX-Aurora TSUBASA, the new vector processor from NEC.

My name is Erich Focht and I work for NEC HPC Europe, doing R&D on
various topics like system architecture, distributed systems software
and vector systems. The posts on this site reflect my personal views
and not those of my employer. The same holds for colleagues and
friends who occasionally contribute content.

Long time ago I worked with vector supercomputers weighing tons,
running proprietary operating systems, using custom CPU technology and
custom high speed interconnects. I always wanted something smaller, a
kind of "personal supercomputer" with the capabilities, efficiency and
easy programmability of these vector machines but the size of a
desktop PC. These days have finally come with the SX-Aurora Vector
Engine (VE)! Everything is still new about this CPU, the OS, the
compilers, the libraries, the Linux-alike look and feel. Sometimes
when I learn something about the VE, I write notes or little posts,
such that I can find the information again and others can - maybe -
save some time and use it for their own developments.
